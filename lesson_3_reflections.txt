Manual vs. automatic pull

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I need to be sure about the changes we do. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
That you can return to the latest commit to make changes. s

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Using pull request it's very easy because the changes they made i check before merge to master. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Yo can do changes and prove befor you merge in the master branch.
