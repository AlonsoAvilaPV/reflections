Reflect: Forks, Clones, and Branches

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is a clone of a github repositoy. 
Clones is a copy to local repositoy for github repository and viseversa.
Branches are a copy of a local repository.

Manual vs. automatic pull

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I need to be sure about the changes we do. 


Commads:
cd namefile/ : entrar a una carpeta.
git remote : See the current remote.
git remote add name github repositoy URL  : to create a new remote call whit whatever name you want. 
git remote .v : Verife the remote called origin. 
git push remote_name branch_name : copy all the commits rechably on my branch_name to remote_name includin the same name.
